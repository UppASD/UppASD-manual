# UppASD manual

## About the document

The contents of the UppASD manual are edited using the template sphinx-lesson

https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-lesson/

for use with the Sphinx documentation generator. The manual can be rendered on a local
computer to html files and tex files following the instructions in the readme of sphinx-lesson.

The manual can also be automatically built with Github actions and deployed to Github pages.
This is how we eventually will web host the manual.
