# UppASD manual

User manual for the [Uppsala Atomistic Spin Dynamics][1] program.

## About the document

The contents of the UppASD manual are edited using the CodeRefinery template sphinx-lesson

https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template

for use with the sphinx-lesson

https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-lesson/

extension of the Sphinx documentation generator. The manual can be rendered on a local
computer to html files and tex files following the instructions in the readme of sphinx-lesson.

The manual can also be automatically built with Github actions and deployed to Github pages.
This is how we eventually will web host the manual.
